NHBEA Database Schema Research Analysis

  Executive Summary & Recommendations

  Recommended Approach: Hybrid Architecture - Keep Firestore with strategic
  optimizations, but plan for future SQL integration.

  Immediate Action: Implement a 3-phase migration starting with your priority
  collections.

  ---
  1. Schema Validation & Optimization

  ‚úÖ Validated Core Collections (Priority 1)

  # Critical for immediate implementation
  members:          # ‚úÖ Core - membership management
  conference:       # ‚úÖ Core - event management  
  registrants:      # ‚úÖ Core - conference attendees
  awards:          # ‚úÖ Core - recognition system
  nominations:     # ‚úÖ Core - award submissions
  committees:      # ‚úÖ Core - organizational structure

  üîß Schema Optimizations Needed

  1. Consolidate Redundant Collections
  # BEFORE (Redundant)
  site_settings: {}
  sitesettings: {footertext, sitename, tagline...}

  # AFTER (Consolidated)
  site_settings: {footertext, sitename, tagline, ...}

  2. Enhance Member Collection Structure
  members:
    # Current inconsistencies noted
    name.first_name & name.last_name  # vs plain 'name'
    membershipType vs membershiptype   # Inconsistent casing

    # Recommended structure:
    personalInfo: {firstName, lastName, email, phone}
    membership: {type, status, joinDate, renewalDate}
    organization: {name, position, address}
    preferences: {emailNotifications, privacy}

  3. Strengthen Nomination Workflow
  nominations:
    # Add workflow status tracking
    status: [draft, submitted, under_review, approved, rejected]
    workflow: {
      submittedAt: timestamp,
      reviewedAt: timestamp,
      reviewedBy: memberId,
      decision: string,
      feedback: string
    }

  2. Database Technology Assessment

  Firestore Suitability: ‚ö†Ô∏è Moderate with Caveats

  ‚úÖ Firestore Advantages for NHBEA:
  - Perfect for SMB scale (< 10K members, < 100 events/year)
  - Excellent Firebase ecosystem integration
  - Real-time updates for nominations, registrations
  - Built-in security rules for member data protection
  - Cost-effective at your anticipated scale

  ‚ö†Ô∏è Firestore Limitations to Monitor:
  - Complex reporting queries will become challenging
  - No true relationships - requires careful denormalization
  - Limited analytical capabilities for membership insights

  Recommended Architecture: Firestore + Strategic Enhancements

  Phase 1: Pure Firestore (Months 1-6)
    - Implement core collections
    - Use Cloud Functions for complex business logic
    - Denormalize for common queries

  Phase 2: Hybrid Approach (Months 6-12)
    - Add BigQuery for reporting/analytics
    - Firestore ‚Üí BigQuery sync for complex queries
    - Keep Firestore for operational data

  Phase 3: Future-Proofing (Year 2+)
    - Evaluate SQL migration if complexity grows
    - Consider Supabase/PostgreSQL for advanced features

  3. Critical Data Relationships & Queries

  Key Relationship Patterns

  1. Member ‚Üí Committee Relationship
  // Denormalized approach for Firestore
  committees: {
    chair: {memberId, name, email},      // Denormalized member data
    members: [{memberId, name, role}]    // Array of member references
  }

  members: {
    committees: [committeeId1, committeeId2]  // Back-reference for queries
  }

  2. Nomination ‚Üí Award ‚Üí Member Chain
  nominations: {
    awardId: "award_123",
    awardName: "Teacher of the Year",      // Denormalized for display
    nomineeId: "member_456",
    nomineeName: "John Smith",             // Denormalized for queries
    status: "under_review"
  }

  3. Conference ‚Üí Registration Aggregation
  conference: {
    registrationCount: 0,                  // Maintained via Cloud Functions
    registrationLimit: 150,
    registrationFee: 100
  }

  Query Optimization Strategy

  Common Query Patterns & Solutions:

  1. "Show all nominations for Award X"
  // Firestore compound index needed
  nominations.where("awardId", "==", awardId)
           .where("status", "==", "submitted")
  2. "List all active committee members"
  // Denormalized committee membership
  members.where("committees", "array-contains", committeeId)
         .where("status", "==", "active")
  3. "Conference attendee report"
  // Use Cloud Function for complex aggregation
  registrants.where("conferenceTitle", "==", "2025 Annual Conference")

  4. Migration Strategy - 3-Phase Approach

  Phase 1: Core Operations (Months 1-2)

  Priority Collections:
  - members (enhanced structure)
  - conference (current + future events)
  - registrants (conference attendees)
  - site_settings (consolidated)

  Deliverables:
  - ‚úÖ Member registration/management
  - ‚úÖ Conference registration system
  - ‚úÖ Basic admin dashboard

  Phase 2: Awards & Engagement (Months 2-4)

  Additional Collections:
  - awards
  - nominations
  - committees
  - news
  - events

  Deliverables:
  - ‚úÖ Nomination workflow
  - ‚úÖ Committee management
  - ‚úÖ News/events publishing

  Phase 3: Advanced Features (Months 4-6)

  Remaining Collections:
  - resources (member resources)
  - testimonials
  - forms (dynamic forms)
  - halloffame
  - organizations

  5. Implementation Recommendations

  Firestore Security Rules Strategy

  // Example: Member data protection
  match /members/{memberId} {
    allow read: if request.auth != null &&
      (request.auth.uid == memberId || isAdmin());
    allow write: if request.auth.uid == memberId || isAdmin();
  }

  // Nomination workflow protection
  match /nominations/{nominationId} {
    allow create: if request.auth != null && validateNomination();
    allow update: if isCommitteeMember() || isAdmin();
    allow read: if canViewNomination();
  }

  Cloud Functions for Business Logic

  // Auto-update registration counts
  exports.updateRegistrationCount = functions.firestore
    .document('registrants/{registrantId}')
    .onCreate(async (snap, context) => {
      // Update conference.registrationCount
    });

  // Nomination workflow triggers
  exports.processNomination = functions.firestore
    .document('nominations/{nominationId}')
    .onUpdate(async (change, context) => {
      // Send notifications, update statuses
    });

  FireCMS Configuration Strategy

  # Optimize FireCMS for complex relationships
  collections:
    nominations:
      properties:
        award:
          dataType: "reference"
          path: "awards"
          previewProperties: ["name", "category"]

    members:
      subcollections:
        - applications
        - membership_history

  6. Cost & Performance Projections

  Firestore Cost Estimate (SMB Scale)

  Assumptions:
    - 500 active members
    - 50 new members/year
    - 2 conferences/year (100 attendees each)
    - 20 award nominations/year

  Monthly Firestore Costs:
    - Document reads: ~50K reads = $3
    - Document writes: ~5K writes = $1.50
    - Storage: ~1GB = $0.18

  Total: ~$5-10/month (well within SMB budget)

  Performance Expectations

  - Member lookups: <100ms
  - Conference registration: <200ms
  - Complex reports: 1-3 seconds (acceptable for admin)
  - Real-time updates: Instant via Firestore listeners

  7. Risk Assessment & Mitigation

  High-Priority Risks

  1. Data Migration Complexity
  - Risk: Existing content corruption during migration
  - Mitigation: Comprehensive backup + staged migration with rollback plans

  2. Query Performance Degradation
  - Risk: Complex reports become too slow
  - Mitigation: BigQuery integration planned for Phase 2

  3. Firestore Limitations Discovery
  - Risk: Business requirements exceed Firestore capabilities
  - Mitigation: Architecture allows hybrid/migration to SQL databases

  Medium-Priority Risks

  4. Security Rule Complexity
  - Risk: Complex permissions become unmanageable
  - Mitigation: Security rule testing + documentation

  5. FireCMS Scaling Limitations
  - Risk: CMS can't handle relationship complexity
  - Mitigation: Custom admin interfaces as fallback
