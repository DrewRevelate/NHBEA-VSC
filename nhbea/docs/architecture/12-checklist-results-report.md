# 12. Checklist Results Report
A validation check using the Architect Checklist was performed. The architecture is sound and ready for implementation.

Requirements Alignment: The architecture directly supports all functional and non-functional requirements in the PRD.

Clarity & Simplicity: The serverless approach using Next.js and Firebase is a simple, modern, and powerful solution for this project's needs.

AI Agent Suitability: The well-defined project structure, use of TypeScript, and clear separation of concerns in the /lib directory make this architecture highly suitable for implementation by AI developer agents.
