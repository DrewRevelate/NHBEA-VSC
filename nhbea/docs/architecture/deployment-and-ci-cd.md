# Deployment and CI/CD
Deployment Platform: The application will be deployed to Firebase Hosting, which provides a global CDN, automatic SSL, and tight integration with the Firebase backend.

CI/CD Pipeline: A GitHub Actions workflow will be created to automate deployments. The pipeline will trigger on pushes to the main branch, install dependencies, build the Next.js application, and deploy to Firebase Hosting.
