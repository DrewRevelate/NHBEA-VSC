# 13. V1 Data Migration Strategy

## Migration Approach
The system will support importing existing V1 data through dedicated migration scripts that:

1. **Organizations**: Direct import with ID preservation
2. **Members**: Import with structure transformation to maintain V1 nested format while adding new fields
3. **Conference**: Import 2025 conference data with full fee structure
4. **Registrants**: Import with participant structure preservation
5. **Awards**: Create award types from V1 data
6. **Sponsors**: Direct import maintaining display order

## Migration Utilities Location
Migration scripts will be placed in `/src/lib/v1DataImport.ts` with:
- CSV parsing utilities
- Data transformation functions
- Firestore batch import capabilities
- Validation and error reporting

## Post-Migration Validation
- Verify all organization references resolve correctly
- Ensure member board positions sync with boardMembers collection
- Validate conference registration counts match
- Confirm award categories are properly established
