3. Visit: http://localhost:3000/about (see board members from enhanced data)
4. Test FireCMS: https://app.firecms.co/p/nhbea-64cab

## What You'll See After Setup

### In Firestore Console:
- **organizations**: 5 educational institutions
- **members**: 6 members (5 board members with proper roles)
- **conference**: 2 conferences (1 in-person, 1 virtual)
- **registrants**: 4 registrations with proper member links

### In FireCMS Dashboard:
- Rich forms with dropdowns and references
- Board members managed through members collection
- Virtual conference support with URL fields
- Registrant linking to members and payment tracking

### On Your Website:
- Board members automatically loaded from enhanced data
- Proper hierarchical ordering (President, VP, Secretary, etc.)
- All existing functionality preserved

## Troubleshooting

### "Collections not showing in FireCMS"
- Make sure you're logged into: https://app.firecms.co/p/nhbea-64cab
- Recreate collections manually using the field definitions above
- Ensure paths match exactly (organizations, members, conference, registrants)

### "No data in collections"
- Re-run the seed migration at: http://localhost:3000/admin/migrate
- Check Firestore console for data: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/nhbea-64cab/firestore

### "Board members not showing on website"
- Visit: http://localhost:3000/about
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify members collection has isBoardMember: true entries

## Next Steps

1. **Customize the data**: Edit entries in FireCMS to match your real organization
2. **Add more members**: Use the enhanced members form in FireCMS
3. **Create conferences**: Use the enhanced conference form with virtual options
4. **Test registrations**: Create registrants that link to members

Your enhanced CMS is now ready! ðŸŽ‰
