# Technical Assumptions
Repository Structure
Decision: The project will be housed in a single Monorepo.

Rationale: This approach is standard for full-stack Next.js applications, simplifying dependency management and allowing for shared types and utilities.

Service Architecture
Decision: The project will use a Serverless architecture.

Rationale: This leverages the capabilities of the chosen stack, using Firebase for database, storage, and backend logic, and Firebase Hosting for deployment.

Testing Requirements
Decision: The project will use Jest and React Testing Library for unit/integration testing, and Cypress for end-to-end testing.

Rationale: This is an industry-standard suite for the Next.js/React ecosystem that provides comprehensive test coverage.

Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
The specific technology stack outlined in the README.md is a firm requirement.

Form handling will be managed using React Hook Form with Zod for data validation.
