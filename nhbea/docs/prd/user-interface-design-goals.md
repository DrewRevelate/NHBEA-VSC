# User Interface Design Goals
Overall UX Vision
The user experience for NHBEA Connect should be professional, modern, and streamlined. The design will prioritize clarity and ease of use, ensuring that first-time visitors can navigate intuitively while returning members can accomplish tasks efficiently. The overall vision is a welcoming and trustworthy digital headquarters that reflects the quality of the association.

Key Interaction Paradigms
Simple Form Submission: All forms (conference, membership, nomination) will be single-purpose, clearly labeled, and easy to complete. Validation will be clear and helpful.

Secure Checkout Flow: The transition to the payment processor (Square) will be seamless and clearly communicated, building user trust during financial transactions.

Information Discovery: Content-heavy pages like "About Us" and "Hall of Fame" will be structured for easy reading and navigation.
