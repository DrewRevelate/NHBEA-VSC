# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

Improve Operational Efficiency: Significantly reduce the administrative workload on the board by automating key functions like conference registrations and membership due collections.

Enhance Professional Image: Elevate the association's public image by replacing the outdated system with a modern, polished, and professional website.

Streamline Content Management: Empower the board to perform routine content updates through a simple online portal (FireCMS), eliminating dependency on developers for minor text changes.

Increase Member Engagement: Provide a central, reliable source of information to keep members better informed and more engaged with association activities.

## Background Context

This project is a comprehensive modernization and replacement of the New Hampshire Business Education Association's current website, NHBEA.org. The primary driver is the need to solve the significant inefficiency and administrative burden caused by the current site's reliance on manual processes for core functions. By automating membership and event transactions and providing a user-friendly content management system, the new platform will free up the board's time, present a more professional image, and ultimately allow the association to better serve its members.
