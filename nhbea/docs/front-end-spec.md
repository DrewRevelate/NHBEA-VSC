NHBEA Connect UI/UX Specification
1. Introduction
This document defines the user experience goals, information architecture, user flows, and visual design specifications for NHBEA Connect's user interface. It serves as the foundation for visual design and frontend development, ensuring a cohesive and user-centered experience.

Overall UX Goals & Principles
Target User Personas
Current & Prospective Members: Professionals who need efficient access to information and streamlined processes for joining, renewing, and registering for events.

Students: Future professionals who need a simple and clear path to apply for membership.

The Public & School Administrators: An audience that requires a professional and clear presentation of the association's mission and impact.

Usability Goals
Ease of Learning: A first-time visitor should be able to understand the site's purpose and successfully complete a core task (like finding conference info or starting a membership application) within minutes.

Efficiency of Use: Key tasks like paying for a conference or membership should be completable in as few steps as possible.

Error Prevention: Forms and payment flows will have clear validation and guidance to prevent user errors.

Design Principles
Clarity Above All: The interface will prioritize clear, unambiguous language and intuitive navigation over clever or complex design.

Streamlined Workflows: Every task, especially multi-step processes like registration and payment, will be designed to be as simple and frictionless as possible.

Trust & Transparency: The design will build user trust, especially during payment, with clear communication, professional aesthetics, and secure-feeling interactions.

4. Component Library / Design System
Design System Approach: We will use the existing ShadCN UI component library, which is built on Tailwind CSS. This provides a set of accessible, unstyled components that can be tailored to our specific brand needs. We will not be creating a new design system from scratch.

Core Components: Key components to be styled and used will include Buttons, Input Fields, Forms, Cards (for displaying members/awards), Tables, and Navigation elements.

5. Branding & Style Guide
Visual Identity: The design will incorporate the existing NHBEA logo and brand colors, applied within a modern and professional aesthetic.

Color Palette: TBD. The primary, secondary, and accent colors will need to be formally defined based on NHBEA's branding.

Typography: TBD. We will select a primary font for headings and a secondary font for body text that is professional and highly readable.

6. Accessibility Requirements
Compliance Target: The website will adhere to WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines to ensure it is accessible to users with disabilities.

Key Requirements:

All images will have descriptive alternative text.

The site will be fully navigable using a keyboard.

Color contrast ratios will meet AA standards.

Forms will have proper labels and ARIA attributes.

7. Responsiveness Strategy
Breakpoints: The site will use standard breakpoints for Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop displays.

Adaptation Patterns: The design will follow a mobile-first approach. On smaller screens, complex layouts will stack vertically, and navigation will collapse into a mobile-friendly menu.

8. Next Steps
Handoff to Architect: This specification, along with the PRD, will be handed off to the Architect to create the detailed Fullstack Architecture document.

Visual Design: A visual designer should use this document to create high-fidelity mockups in a tool like Figma.
