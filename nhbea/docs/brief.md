Project Brief: NHBEA Connect
1. Executive Summary (Revision 1)
NHBEA Connect will serve as a comprehensive modernization and replacement for the association's current website, NHBEA.org. The project's goal is to transform the existing platform into a professional, modern digital headquarters that automates core administrative functions, such as membership applications and conference registrations. The primary problem this project solves is the inefficiency and administrative burden of the manual processes required by the current site. The new platform targets current and prospective professional members, students, and school administrators by offering a streamlined and secure way to pay dues, register for events, and engage with the NHBEA. The key value proposition is to elevate the association's professional image, dramatically improve operational efficiency, and boost member engagement by replacing the outdated system with a powerful, modern tool.

2. Problem Statement
Current State & Pain Points:
The New Hampshire Business Education Association (NHBEA) currently relies on an outdated website that necessitates significant manual effort from the board for core operational tasks. Key functions, such as processing conference registrations and collecting membership dues, are not automated, leading to a high administrative burden. This manual workflow is inefficient, prone to error, and consumes valuable time that board members could be dedicating to strategic initiatives.

Why the Current Solution is Insufficient:
The existing website, NHBEA.org, falls short in several key areas. It lacks the capability to handle secure, online payments for memberships or events, which is a standard expectation for a modern professional organization. Furthermore, the content management system is not user-friendly, requiring technical assistance for even minor text updates, which creates a bottleneck for timely communication. This inflexibility results in a static, less engaging platform for members and projects an unprofessional image to the public and potential members.

Impact of the Problem:
The primary impact is a drain on the board's productivity and the association's overall efficiency. The lack of automation also presents a barrier to engagement for members, who face a cumbersome process for payments and registrations. Ultimately, the current website hinders the NHBEA's ability to serve its members effectively and grow the association.

3. Proposed Solution
Core Concept & Approach:
The proposed solution is NHBEA Connect, a modern, professional, and user-friendly website that will serve as the association's digital headquarters. The platform will be built to automate and streamline core operational functions, replacing the current site's inefficient, manual processes.

Key Differentiators & Vision for Success:
This solution will succeed by directly addressing the shortcomings of the current website through two key differentiators:

Operational Automation: The site will integrate a secure payment partner (Square) to handle all conference and membership transactions automatically. This eliminates the need for manual processing by the board, ensuring efficiency and accuracy.

Ease of Management: Content on the website will be easily updatable through a simple online portal (FireCMS), empowering the board to make timely changes without needing to hire a developer for minor edits.

The high-level vision for NHBEA Connect is to create a powerful asset that enhances the association's professionalism, streamlines operations through automation, and fosters greater member engagement by providing a reliable and central source of information.

Technology Preferences

Frontend: Next.js (App Router), React, TypeScript, ShadCN UI for components, and Tailwind CSS for styling.

Backend & Database: Firebase will be used for backend services, including Cloud Firestore for the database and CMS content, and Firebase Hosting.

Payment Processing: Secure payment processing will be handled via the Square API.

Form Handling: Forms will be managed using React Hook Form with Zod for data validation.

Architecture Considerations

Repository Structure: The project will be housed in a single repository following a standard Next.js App Router structure.

Service Architecture: The architecture will be serverless, leveraging Firebase for database and backend logic, and Next.js for both frontend rendering and potential API routes.

Integration Requirements: The primary integrations are with Firebase for data and content, and the Square API for all payment processing.

Security/Compliance: Security will be managed through Firestore security rules and by leveraging Square's secure, hosted checkout pages for all financial transactions.

9. Constraints & Assumptions (Revision 1)
Constraints

Budget: Development is being provided as an in-kind contribution. Any costs related to third-party services (e.g., Firebase or Square usage fees beyond their free tiers) are out of scope unless otherwise specified.

Timeline: The desired timeline is "as soon as possible". We will establish more detailed milestones, but the overall goal is an accelerated delivery.

Resources: Development resources are being provided in-kind. The NHBEA board is the primary stakeholder and content provider.

Technical: The project is constrained to the specific technology stack detailed in the README.md, including Next.js and Firebase.

Key Assumptions

Content Readiness: (Validated) All necessary content has been provided by the board and is uploaded to Firebase Storage, ready for integration.

Third-Party Accounts: It is assumed that the NHBEA's Firebase and Square accounts are fully configured and ready for production use (e.g., payment processing is enabled on the Square account).

Domain Name Access: (Validated) Administrative access to the NHBEA.org domain's DNS is confirmed and available for pointing to the new website upon launch.

MVP Sufficiency: It is assumed that the features defined in the MVP scope are sufficient to fully replace the essential functions of the old website.

10. Risks & Open Questions
Key Risks

Timeline Pressure: The "ASAP" timeline, while reflecting urgency, introduces a risk of accumulating technical debt if testing or best practices are rushed to meet deadlines.

Third-Party Dependency: The project's core functionality relies on external services (Firebase and Square). Any unexpected changes to their APIs, pricing, or terms of service could impact the site's operation and budget.

Post-Launch Support: As an in-kind project, there is a risk that long-term maintenance and support needs are not clearly defined, potentially leaving the board without technical help after the initial launch.

Open Questions

Long-Term Maintenance: What is the plan for ongoing maintenance, bug fixes, and security updates after the website is delivered?

Service Costs: Have the potential long-term costs for Firebase and Square been estimated if usage grows beyond the free tiers? Who will be responsible for this budget?

Board Training: What is the plan for training the NHBEA board members on how to use the FireCMS content management system effectively?

Legal Policies: Does the website require a Privacy Policy and/or Terms of Use, given that it collects personal information for membership and event registration?

Areas Needing Further Research

Firebase Security Rules: A detailed review and implementation of robust Firestore security rules is needed to ensure all user and association data is secure.

Square API Error Handling: Researching and implementing best practices for handling various payment failure scenarios (e.g., declined cards, interrupted connections) to ensure a smooth user experience.
