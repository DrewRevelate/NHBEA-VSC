NHBEA Connect Product Requirements Document (PRD)
1. Goals and Background Context
Goals
Improve Operational Efficiency: Significantly reduce the administrative workload on the board by automating key functions like conference registrations and membership due collections.

Enhance Professional Image: Elevate the association's public image by replacing the outdated system with a modern, polished, and professional website.

Streamline Content Management: Empower the board to perform routine content updates through a simple online portal (FireCMS), eliminating dependency on developers for minor text changes.

Increase Member Engagement: Provide a central, reliable source of information to keep members better informed and more engaged with association activities.

Background Context
This project is a comprehensive modernization and replacement of the New Hampshire Business Education Association's current website, NHBEA.org. The primary driver is the need to solve the significant inefficiency and administrative burden caused by the current site's reliance on manual processes for core functions. By automating membership and event transactions and providing a user-friendly content management system, the new platform will free up the board's time, present a more professional image, and ultimately allow the association to better serve its members.

Accessibility
Decision: To ensure the site is usable by the widest possible audience, we will target WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.

Branding
Decision: The design will incorporate the existing NHBEA logo and brand colors, but apply them within a modern and updated visual design system.

Target Device and Platforms
The application will be a Web Responsive site, designed to work seamlessly across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

4. Technical Assumptions
Repository Structure
Decision: The project will be housed in a single Monorepo.

Rationale: This approach is standard for full-stack Next.js applications, simplifying dependency management and allowing for shared types and utilities.

Service Architecture
Decision: The project will use a Serverless architecture.

Rationale: This leverages the capabilities of the chosen stack, using Firebase for database, storage, and backend logic, and Firebase Hosting for deployment.

Testing Requirements
Decision: The project will use Jest and React Testing Library for unit/integration testing, and Cypress for end-to-end testing.

Rationale: This is an industry-standard suite for the Next.js/React ecosystem that provides comprehensive test coverage.

Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
The specific technology stack outlined in the README.md is a firm requirement.

Form handling will be managed using React Hook Form with Zod for data validation.
