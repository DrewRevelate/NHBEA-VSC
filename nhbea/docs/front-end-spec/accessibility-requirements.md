# Accessibility Requirements

## Compliance Target

The website will adhere to **WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines** to ensure it is accessible to users with disabilities.

## Key Requirements

### Visual Accessibility

**Alternative Text**: All images will have descriptive alternative text that conveys the purpose and content of the image.

**Color Contrast**: Color contrast ratios will meet AA standards:
- Normal text: minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio
- Large text (18pt+ or 14pt+ bold): minimum 3:1 contrast ratio
- Non-text elements: minimum 3:1 contrast ratio

**Color Independence**: Information will not be conveyed through color alone; additional indicators (icons, text, patterns) will be used.

### Keyboard Navigation

**Full Keyboard Access**: The site will be fully navigable using only a keyboard, including:
- Tab navigation through all interactive elements
- Enter and Space key activation for buttons and links
- Arrow key navigation for complex widgets
- Escape key to close modals and menus

**Focus Management**: 
- Clear visual focus indicators for all interactive elements
- Logical tab order that follows the visual layout
- Focus trapping in modals and pop-up dialogs

### Form Accessibility

**Proper Labels**: Forms will have proper labels and ARIA attributes:
- All form fields will have associated labels
- Required fields will be clearly marked
- Error messages will be programmatically associated with form fields
- Fieldsets and legends for grouped form controls

**Validation and Error Handling**:
- Clear, descriptive error messages
- Errors announced to screen readers
- Prevention of form submission until errors are resolved

### Screen Reader Support

**Semantic HTML**: Use proper HTML5 semantic elements:
- Headings (h1-h6) in logical hierarchy
- Lists for grouped content
- Navigation landmarks
- Main content areas properly marked

**ARIA Implementation**:
- ARIA labels for complex interactive elements
- ARIA live regions for dynamic content updates
- ARIA expanded states for collapsible content
- ARIA describedby for additional context

### Content Structure

**Heading Hierarchy**: Logical heading structure with no skipped levels
**Reading Order**: Content order in DOM matches visual reading order
**Page Titles**: Unique, descriptive page titles for each page
**Link Context**: Link text that makes sense out of context
