    participant User
    participant Website

    User->>Website: Navigates to Membership Page
    User->>Website: Clicks "Join Now" (Professional)
    User->>Website: Fills out application form
    Website-->>User: Validates form
    Website->>Square: Requests payment link
    Square-->>Website: Returns payment link
    Website-->>User: Redirects to Square Checkout
    User->>Square: Enters payment information
    Square-->>Website: Confirms payment status (webhook/redirect)
    Website-->>User: Displays Success/Confirmation Page
```

### Optimization Guidelines

- **Form Validation**: Implement real-time validation to prevent errors before submission
- **Progress Indicators**: Show users where they are in the multi-step process
- **Auto-save**: Save form progress to prevent data loss
- **Clear Call-to-Actions**: Use prominent, descriptive buttons that guide user actions

### Flow Optimization Priorities

1. **Minimize Form Fields**: Only collect essential information upfront
2. **Smart Defaults**: Pre-populate known user information when possible
3. **Error Recovery**: Provide clear paths to resolve form validation errors
4. **Payment Security**: Ensure secure payment processing with clear security indicators
5. **Confirmation Clarity**: Provide detailed confirmation with next steps and contact information
