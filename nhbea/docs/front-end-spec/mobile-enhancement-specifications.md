# Mobile Enhancement Specifications

## Responsiveness Strategy

### Breakpoints
The site will use standard breakpoints for optimal display across devices:

- **Mobile**: 320px - 767px
- **Tablet**: 768px - 1023px  
- **Desktop**: 1024px and above

### Mobile-First Approach
The design will follow a mobile-first approach where:
- Base styles are optimized for mobile devices
- Progressive enhancement adds features for larger screens
- Complex layouts stack vertically on smaller screens
- Navigation collapses into a mobile-friendly menu

## Adaptation Patterns

### Navigation
- **Mobile**: Hamburger menu with slide-out or overlay navigation
- **Tablet/Desktop**: Horizontal navigation bar with dropdowns

### Forms
- **Mobile**: Single-column layout with larger touch targets
- **Tablet/Desktop**: Multi-column layouts where appropriate
- **All Devices**: Proper input types for mobile keyboards (email, tel, number)

### Content Layout
- **Mobile**: Stacked content blocks with generous spacing
- **Tablet**: Two-column layouts where content allows
- **Desktop**: Multi-column layouts with optimal reading widths

### Tables and Data Display
- **Mobile**: Card-based layout or horizontal scrolling
- **Tablet/Desktop**: Traditional table layouts with proper spacing

## Touch Interface Optimization

### Touch Targets
- Minimum 44px Ã— 44px touch targets for all interactive elements
- Adequate spacing between clickable elements (minimum 8px)
- Clear visual feedback for touch interactions

### Gestures
- Support for standard mobile gestures (swipe, pinch-to-zoom where appropriate)
- Prevent accidental interactions with proper touch handling

## Performance on Mobile

### Loading Optimization
- Optimize images for mobile bandwidth constraints
- Implement progressive loading for content below the fold
- Use appropriate image formats (WebP, AVIF) with fallbacks

### Network Considerations
- Design for slower network connections
- Implement offline-friendly features where possible
- Provide loading indicators for network operations

## Mobile-Specific Features

### Device Integration
- Support for device features where relevant (camera for file uploads)
- Proper handling of device orientation changes
- Integration with mobile payment systems

### User Experience Enhancements
- Auto-focus appropriate form fields
- Implement smart form completion
- Provide clear feedback for all user actions
- Use native mobile UI patterns where beneficial
