### Current Conference Page Analysis
The Conference page currently uses a custom layout structure with:
- ShapingTheFutureHero component (needs replacement with FlexibleHero variant='conference')
- ConferenceThemeProvider wrapper (may need integration with new architecture)
- Custom error handling and loading states (replace with standardized components)
- Manual main content wrapper (replace with StandardPageLayout)
- Multiple content sections that need ResponsiveGrid layout implementation
- Complex conference data loading with getCurrentConference(), checkRegistrationAvailability(), getEnhancedConferenceData()

### Standardized Component Architecture Implementation
[Source: Story 5.2 completion notes and Story 5.3 implementation patterns]

**Proven Implementation Patterns from Stories 5.2 and 5.3:**
- StandardPageLayout component (125 lines) - production-ready with comprehensive hero integration
- FlexibleHero component system (408 lines) - 'conference' variant fully implemented and ready for use
- StandardErrorBoundary (156 lines) - comprehensive error handling with retry mechanisms
- ResponsiveGrid system (127 lines) - flexible breakpoint configuration with typography utilities
- Performance optimization patterns with lazy loading and code splitting established

**FlexibleHero Conference Variant Configuration:**
```typescript
// Based on Story 5.2 implementation - FlexibleHero.tsx conference variant
hero={{
  component: FlexibleHero,
  props: {
    variant: 'conference',
    title: conference?.title || 'NHBEA Annual Conference',
    subtitle: 'Join us for professional development and networking',
    conference: {
      title: conference?.title,
      date: conference?.date,
      location: conference?.location,
      registrationOpen: registrationAvailable,
      earlyBirdDeadline: conference?.earlyBirdDeadline,
      theme: conference?.theme
    }
  }
}}
```

**StandardPageLayout Configuration:**
```typescript
// Based on Stories 5.2 and 5.3 patterns
<StandardPageLayout
  hero={{ component: FlexibleHero, props: conferenceHeroProps }}
  error={{ boundary: true }}
  loading={{ enabled: true }}
  meta={{
    title: `${conference?.title || 'Annual Conference'} - NHBEA`,
    description: 'Join NHBEA for professional development, networking, and educational excellence at our annual conference',
    openGraph: true,
    twitterCard: true
  }}
  main={{ id: 'conference-main-content', focusable: true }}
  className="min-h-screen"
>
```

**ResponsiveGrid Implementation:**
```typescript
// Based on Stories 5.2 and 5.3 proven patterns
<ResponsiveGrid gap="lg" className="space-y-16 md:space-y-20">
  {/* Conference content sections */}
</ResponsiveGrid>
```

### Data Model Requirements
[Source: Current Conference page implementation analysis]

The Conference page handles multiple data sources:
- Conference data via getCurrentConference() for main conference information
- Registration status via checkRegistrationAvailability() for registration availability
- Enhanced conference data via getEnhancedConferenceData() for additional details
- Speakers data for SpeakersSection component
- Venue information for VenueInformation component
- Maintains dynamic metadata generation based on conference data

### File Structure Requirements
[Source: Stories 5.2 and 5.3 implementation patterns]

**Target file location:** `/src/app/conference/page.tsx` (modify existing)

**Component imports needed (verified from Stories 5.2 and 5.3):**
```typescript
// Standardized components from Stories 5.2 and 5.3 implementation
import { StandardPageLayout } from '@/components/StandardPageLayout'
import { FlexibleHero } from '@/components/FlexibleHero'
import { StandardErrorBoundary } from '@/components/StandardErrorBoundary'
import { ResponsiveGrid } from '@/components/ResponsiveGrid'
import { LoadingSpinner, LoadingSkeleton } from '@/components/LoadingSpinner'
```

**Components to remove imports:**
- ShapingTheFutureHero (replaced by FlexibleHero with variant='conference')
- ConferenceThemeProvider (integrate functionality into StandardPageLayout if needed)
- Custom error handling patterns (replaced by StandardErrorBoundary)

**Lazy Loading Imports (following Stories 5.2 and 5.3 patterns):**
```typescript
// Non-critical sections should be lazy loaded
const ConferenceFAQ = lazy(() => import('@/components/ConferenceFAQ'))
const SocialMediaFeed = lazy(() => import('@/components/SocialMediaFeed'))
const VenueInformation = lazy(() => import('@/components/VenueInformation'))
```

### Performance Requirements
[Source: Stories 5.2 and 5.3 completion notes]

- Maintain or improve current bundle size metrics (target similar to About page: ~4.5 kB)
- Implement code splitting for below-the-fold sections (ConferenceFAQ, SocialMediaFeed, VenueInformation)
- Use lazy loading patterns established in homepage and about page migrations
- Target Core Web Vitals: LCP <2.5s, FID <100ms, CLS <0.1

### Error Handling Strategy
[Source: Stories 5.2 and 5.3 StandardErrorBoundary patterns]

Replace manual error state management with StandardErrorBoundary:
- Wrap each major section (agenda, speakers, venue, FAQ) individually
- Configure with appropriate retry mechanisms for data-dependent sections
- Maintain development vs production error display patterns
- Preserve existing console logging for debugging

### Accessibility Requirements
[Source: Stories 5.2 and 5.3 StandardPageLayout implementation]

StandardPageLayout provides:
- Skip links automatically configured
- Proper ARIA landmarks and focus management
- Semantic HTML structure with main content area
- Keyboard navigation support

Must preserve existing accessibility features and enhance where possible.
