# Story 1.2: Display Dynamic Homepage Content

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** Visitor,
**I want** to see the main content on the homepage,
**so that** I can quickly understand the mission of NHBEA and see current information.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The homepage fetches and displays the hero section and other page content from the Cloud Firestore database.
2. The homepage dynamically fetches and displays the reel of sponsor logos from Firestore.
3. All content sections are styled professionally.
4. The page is fully responsive.

## Dev Notes
### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1:
- Firebase client and admin SDK configurations are available in src/lib/
- Project structure follows src/ directory organization
- ShadCN UI and Tailwind CSS are configured and ready to use
- Testing framework (Jest & RTL) is set up and functional
- Live deployment pipeline to Firebase Hosting is operational

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/data-models-and-database-schema.md]
- **content collection**: Stores dynamic text and image URLs for pages like the homepage and "About Us". Each document represents a page or section.
- **sponsors collection**: Stores sponsor information (name, logoURL, website).

### Component Architecture Guidelines
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- Components organized by feature or as shared UI elements within /src/components/
- All components built with React and TypeScript, using ShadCN UI as a base
- Component-level state managed with React Hooks (useState, useReducer)
- Server state (data fetched from Firestore) managed via React Server Components and data fetching functions in /src/lib/

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Framework: Next.js ~14.x
- Language: TypeScript ~5.x
- UI Library: React ~18.x
- UI Components: ShadCN UI (Latest)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS (Latest)
- Database: Cloud Firestore
- Testing: Jest & RTL (Latest)

### File Locations for New Code
- Homepage: src/app/page.tsx (modify existing)
- Content fetching: src/lib/content.ts (create new)
- Sponsor fetching: src/lib/sponsors.ts (create new)
- Sponsor component: src/components/SponsorsSection.tsx (create new)
- Hero component: src/components/HeroSection.tsx (create new)
- Type definitions: src/types/content.ts, src/types/sponsors.ts (create new)

### Backend Integration
[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]
- Database interactions performed through functions in /src/lib/
- Use Firebase Client SDK for client-side reads
- Firestore security rules already configured for public reads

### Testing Requirements
Testing Standards from Previous Story:
- Testing framework: Jest & React Testing Library (RTL)
- Create test files alongside components with .test.tsx extension
- Focus on unit and integration testing for data fetching and component rendering
- Test responsive behavior and loading states

### Technical Constraints
- Must use existing Firebase configuration from Story 1.1
- Follow established project structure with src/ directory
- Use ShadCN UI components as base for consistent styling
- Ensure all new code follows TypeScript best practices
- Maintain responsive design principles established in layout
