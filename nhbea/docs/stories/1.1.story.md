# Story 1.1: Project Initialization and Core Layout

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** Board Member,
**I want** the initial Next.js project to be set up with the core layout and styling,
**so that** we have a consistent foundation for all future pages.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The Next.js project is initialized using the App Router, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
2. The project is successfully connected to the Firebase project for hosting and Firestore.
3. A main layout component is created containing a placeholder Header and Footer.
4. The ShadCN UI component library is installed and a basic theme is configured globally.
5. The initial project can be deployed to Firebase Hosting.

  - [x] Run create-next-app with TypeScript and App Router options
  - [x] Configure Tailwind CSS with default setup
  - [x] Verify project structure matches architecture specification
- [x] Setup Firebase integration (AC: 2)

### Frontend Architecture Guidelines
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- Components organized by feature or as shared UI elements within /src/components/
- All components built with React and TypeScript, using ShadCN UI as a base
- Component-level state managed with React Hooks (useState, useReducer)
- Routing handled by Next.js App Router with routes defined by folder structure inside /src/app/

### Backend Architecture Guidelines
[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]
- Serverless architecture - no traditional server
- Database interactions performed through functions in /src/lib/
- Use Firebase Admin SDK for server-side operations
- Use Firebase Client SDK for client-side reads

### Deployment Configuration
[Source: architecture/deployment-and-ci-cd.md]
- Deploy to Firebase Hosting (provides global CDN, automatic SSL)
- Future CI/CD: GitHub Actions workflow will be created to automate deployments

### File Locations for New Code
- Root layout: src/app/layout.tsx
- Header component: src/components/Header.tsx
- Footer component: src/components/Footer.tsx
- Firebase config: firebase.json (root)
- Firestore rules: firestore.rules (root)
- Global styles: src/app/globals.css

### Testing
Testing Standards from Architecture:
- Testing framework: Jest & React Testing Library (RTL)
- No specific testing strategy document found in architecture docs
- Create test files alongside components with .test.tsx extension
- Focus on unit and integration testing for this story
