## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
Building upon the complete Epic 4 brand implementation including:
- **Foundation CSS System (Story 4.1)**: Conservative royal blue color palette (#2563eb) implemented as comprehensive design token architecture with brand, semantic, and component-level tokens
- **Typography Hierarchy (Story 4.2)**: Inter + Georgia font system with modular scale implementation and responsive typography adjustments
- **Core Component Transformation (Story 4.3)**: Buttons, navigation, forms, and cards transformed with conservative royal blue brand system and accessibility compliance

- **Performance Monitoring**: Vercel Analytics and Lighthouse integration for Core Web Vitals tracking with brand-specific thresholds
- **Browser Support**: Modern browsers with CSS custom property support requiring comprehensive fallback testing

### Brand Testing Technical Specifications
[Source: docs/front-end-spec/brand/7-digital-implementation.md]

**Design Token Validation Requirements**:
```css
/* Required CSS Custom Property Structure for Testing */
:root {
  /* Brand Level Tokens (Primary Validation) */
  --brand-primary: var(--nhbea-royal-blue);          /* #2563eb */
  --brand-primary-dark: var(--nhbea-royal-blue-dark); /* #1d4ed8 */
  --brand-primary-light: var(--nhbea-royal-blue-light); /* #3b82f6 */
  
  /* Semantic Level Tokens (Usage Validation) */
  --color-text-primary: var(--nhbea-gray-800);
  --color-bg-primary: var(--nhbea-white);
  --color-border-primary: var(--nhbea-gray-200);
  
  /* Component Level Tokens (Implementation Validation) */
  --button-primary-bg: var(--brand-primary);
  --button-primary-hover: var(--brand-primary-dark);
  --input-focus: var(--brand-primary);
}
```

**60-30-10 Color Rule Validation Framework**:
- **60% Royal Blue Usage**: Hero sections, primary navigation, main CTAs, brand elements, focus states
- **30% Neutral Usage**: Page backgrounds, content text, secondary elements, borders, layout structure  
- **10% Accent Usage**: High-priority CTAs (orange), achievement highlights (academic gold), success states (forest green)

### Performance Testing Specifications
[Source: docs/front-end-spec/performance-optimization.md]

**Target Performance Metrics with Brand Implementation**:

- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: < 0.1 (brand styling must not cause layout shifts)
- **Time to Interactive (TTI)**: < 3.5 seconds (complete brand system ready)

**Brand-Specific Performance Considerations**:
- CSS bundle size increase should not exceed 20KB total across all brand implementations
