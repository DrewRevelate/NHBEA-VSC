}
```

### File Structure and Implementation Location
[Source: existing codebase analysis]
- **Primary File**: `/src/app/globals.css` - Update existing component classes in @layer components section
- **Current Component Classes**: `.nhbea-button-primary`, `.nhbea-button-secondary`, `.nhbea-card`, `.nhbea-input`, `.nhbea-nav-link` (lines 264-326)
- **Integration Pattern**: Extend existing component utility classes with new brand styling
- **Token Integration**: Use design tokens from Story 4.1 (lines 8-145) and typography from Story 4.2
- **Component Structure**: Maintain existing ShadCN/ui integration while enhancing with brand styling

### Existing Component Classes to Transform
[Source: /src/app/globals.css analysis]
Current component implementations that require brand transformation:
- **.nhbea-button-primary** (line 264): Basic primary button needing royal blue gradient and enhanced interactions
- **.nhbea-button-secondary** (line 271): Secondary button requiring royal blue outline and hover states
- **.nhbea-card** (line 259): Standard card needing royal blue accent reveals and sophisticated shadows
- **.nhbea-input** (line 278): Input fields requiring royal blue focus states and enhanced feedback
- **.nhbea-nav-link** (line 319): Navigation links needing brand color integration and micro-interactions
- **Utility Classes**: `.nhbea-section`, `.nhbea-container`, text utilities requiring brand integration

### Brand Color System Integration
[Source: docs/front-end-spec/brand/1-complete-brand-color-system.md]
Components must implement the 60-30-10 color rule:
- **60% Royal Blue**: Primary buttons, navigation active states, focus indicators
- **30% Neutral Gray**: Backgrounds, borders, secondary text elements
- **10% Accent Colors**: CTA buttons (orange), success states (green), achievement highlights (gold)

### Component Interaction Patterns
[Source: docs/front-end-spec/brand/4-component-design-language.md]
- **Hover Effects**: translateY(-1px to -4px) with enhanced shadow elevation
- **Focus States**: 4px outline with brand color and proper contrast ratios
- **Transitions**: Use timing tokens (--duration-fast, --duration-normal, --duration-slow)
- **Easing Functions**: Use brand-consistent easing (--ease-standard, --ease-decelerate)

### Responsive Design Requirements
[Source: docs/front-end-spec/brand/7-digital-implementation.md]
- **Mobile Breakpoint (max-width: 768px)**: Adjust component sizes and spacing for mobile layouts
- **Small Screen (max-width: 480px)**: Further optimizations for compact displays
- **Touch Interactions**: Ensure adequate touch targets (44px minimum) for mobile devices
- **Performance**: Component styling must not impact mobile loading performance

### Accessibility Implementation Requirements
- **Color Contrast**: All component color combinations must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards (4.5:1 normal text, 3:1 large text)
- **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive components must support proper keyboard focus management
- **Screen Readers**: Component transformations must not interfere with semantic HTML structure
- **Reduced Motion**: All animations must respect `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` media query

### Integration with Existing Architecture
The component transformations must work seamlessly with:
- **ShadCN/ui Components**: Enhanced styling overlays on existing component structure
- **Tailwind CSS**: Proper integration with utility classes and responsive modifiers
- **Next.js App Router**: Static export compatibility with no dynamic styling requirements
- **Firebase Hosting**: Optimized CSS delivery with proper caching headers

## Testing

**Test File Locations**: Component testing will be validated through existing component test files and visual regression testing using Jest/React Testing Library setup
**Test Standards**: Accessibility testing, performance testing, and cross-browser compatibility testing for transformed components

**Testing Frameworks**: 
- Lighthouse for accessibility and performance validation
- Manual visual testing across breakpoints and component states
- Component integration testing with existing pages
- Color contrast validation tools (axe-core, WAVE)
- Cross-browser testing for CSS custom property and component rendering

**Specific Testing Requirements**:
- Verify all transformed components render correctly with new brand styling across browsers
- Test component hover states, focus states, and interactive transitions
- Validate color contrast ratios for all component color combinations meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- Test responsive component behavior across mobile (768px), tablet, and desktop breakpoints
- Verify component integration with existing ShadCN/ui components and Tailwind utilities
- Test keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility with transformed components
- Validate component performance impact on page loading and rendering times
- Test dark mode component rendering with proper brand color adjustments
- Visual regression testing to ensure transformed components maintain layout integrity
- Test component behavior with reduced motion preferences enabled

**Accessibility Testing Thresholds**:
- Color Contrast Ratio: ≥ 4.5:1 for normal text, ≥ 3:1 for large text in all component states
- Lighthouse Accessibility Score: ≥ 95 (maintain existing score with component enhancements)
- Keyboard Navigation: All interactive components must be fully accessible via keyboard
- Screen Reader Compatibility: Component transformations must not break semantic structure
- Focus Indicators: All focusable elements must have clear, high-contrast focus indicators

**Performance Testing Thresholds**:
- CSS Bundle Size: Component enhancements should not exceed 15KB increase to total CSS bundle
- Lighthouse Performance Score: > 90 (maintain existing performance with enhanced styling)
- First Contentful Paint: < 2.5s (maintain existing performance)
- Component Rendering: Enhanced styling should not cause layout shifts or render blocking
- Animation Performance: All component micro-interactions must run at 60fps on target devices

**Cross-Browser Testing Requirements**:
- Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge compatibility for enhanced component styling
- Mobile Safari and Chrome mobile component rendering validation
- CSS custom property support validation for component tokens
- Gradient and shadow rendering consistency across browsers
- Component interaction testing (hover, focus, active states) across platforms
