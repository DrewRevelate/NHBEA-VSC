## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Stories 3.1 and 3.2, established patterns for content display pages:
- **Data Fetching Pattern**: Use server-side data fetching with proper error handling and loading states
- **Page Structure**: Follow established layout patterns with responsive design
- **Navigation Integration**: Update Header component with new navigation links
- **Testing Standards**: Maintain 90%+ coverage with Jest & RTL
- **Error Handling**: Implement graceful fallbacks for missing data

### Data Models Requirements
[Source: /src/types/dataModels.ts]
The HallOfFameMember interface is already defined:
- **HallOfFameMember model**: id, memberId, name, year, awardType, bio, imageUrl, achievements, order
- **Award types**: 'business_educator_of_the_year' | 'lifetime_achievement' | 'other'
- **Member integration**: Can reference Members collection via memberId for current members

### Existing Hall of Fame Library
[Source: /src/lib/hallOfFame.ts]
The Hall of Fame data access layer is already implemented:
- **getHallOfFameMembers()**: Main function that fetches from Members collection where isHallOfFame=true
- **Data transformation**: Automatically transforms Member records to HallOfFameMember format
- **Sorting**: Orders by hallOfFameOrder field (ascending)
- **Fallback data**: Includes defaultHallOfFameMembers for when Firestore is unavailable
- **Error handling**: Built-in try/catch with fallback to default data

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/core-backend-components.md#tech-stack]
- **Framework**: Next.js ~14.x with App Router
- **Database**: Cloud Firestore - data fetched from members collection
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + ShadCN UI components
- **Testing**: Jest & RTL (Latest) - established testing patterns
- **Static Export**: Must maintain static export compatibility

### File Locations for New Code
[Source: architecture/core-backend-components.md#unified-project-structure]
- **Page Component**: `/src/app/hall-of-fame/page.tsx`
- **Navigation Update**: Update `/src/components/Header.tsx`
- **Types**: Use existing types in `/src/types/dataModels.ts`
- **Data Library**: Reuse existing `/src/lib/hallOfFame.ts`
- **Tests**: Co-located `.test.tsx` files

### Technical Constraints
- Must maintain existing Firebase configuration and architecture
- Cannot break existing functionality from previous epics
- Must maintain design consistency with established component patterns
- Static export functionality must be preserved
- Performance optimizations must be maintained
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance must be preserved

### Display Requirements
[Source: HallOfFameMember interface]
Required display elements for each honoree:
- Member name and year awarded
- Award type (Business Educator of the Year, Lifetime Achievement, etc.)
- Member biography
- Professional photo (with fallback for missing images)
- List of achievements/accomplishments
- Proper ordering by hallOfFameOrder field

### Caching Strategy
[Source: architecture/core-backend-components.md#performance-optimization]
- Hall of Fame data is relatively static and should be cached appropriately
- Consider implementing similar caching pattern as other content pages
- Data changes infrequently so longer cache times are acceptable

## Testing

**Test File Locations**: Co-located `.test.tsx` files alongside components
**Test Standards**: Jest & React Testing Library following patterns from Epic 2 and 3
**Testing Frameworks**: 
- Jest for unit testing
- React Testing Library for component testing
- Mock Firestore responses for Hall of Fame data testing
**Specific Testing Requirements**:
- Hall of Fame page component rendering testing
- Data fetching and error handling testing
- Responsive design testing across device sizes
- Accessibility testing with screen readers
- Empty state testing when no Hall of Fame members exist
- Fallback data testing when Firestore is unavailable
- Member photo loading and fallback testing
- Achievement list display testing
- Award type filtering/display testing
