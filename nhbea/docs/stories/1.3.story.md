# Story 1.3: Display "About Us", Board, and Past Presidents Pages

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** Visitor,
**I want** to learn about the association's mission and its leadership,
**so that** I can understand the organization's history and people.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. An "About Us" page is created that displays mission and history content from Firestore.
2. The "About Us" page dynamically displays the list of Current Board Members from Firestore.
3. A page or section is created that dynamically displays the list of Past Presidents.
4. All new pages are accessible from the main site navigation and are fully responsive.

## Dev Notes
### Lessons Learned from Story 1.2
- Modern glass morphism design with sophisticated gradients established
- Comprehensive error handling with production/development modes implemented
- Accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA) and reduced motion support required
- 96%+ test coverage standard established
- Performance optimizations (will-change, smooth scrolling) should be maintained

### Data Models Requirements
[Source: architecture/data-models-and-database-schema.md]
- **content collection**: Use for About Us mission and history content
- **boardMembers collection**: Stores information for each current board member (name, title, bio, imageURL)
- **pastPresidents collection**: Stores a list of past presidents (name, term)

### Component Architecture Guidelines
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- Follow established pattern: components in /src/components/, data fetching in /src/lib/
- Use React Server Components for data fetching and client components for interactivity
- Maintain ShadCN UI design system consistency
- Implement proper TypeScript interfaces in /src/types/

### Navigation Integration
- Add "About" link to existing header navigation
- Consider dropdown or mega-menu if multiple About-related pages needed
- Maintain responsive navigation design from Story 1.1

### Technical Patterns from Story 1.2
- Use same error handling pattern (ErrorFallback component)
- Implement fallback content for offline scenarios
- Follow established animation and styling patterns
- Maintain accessibility features (skip links, ARIA labels, semantic HTML)

### File Locations for New Code
- About page: src/app/about/page.tsx (create new)
- Board data fetching: src/lib/board.ts (create new)
- Past presidents data: src/lib/pastPresidents.ts (create new)
- Board component: src/components/BoardMembersSection.tsx (create new)
- Past presidents component: src/components/PastPresidentsSection.tsx (create new)
- Type definitions: src/types/board.ts, src/types/pastPresidents.ts (create new)

### Design Considerations
- Board member cards should include photos, names, titles, and brief bios
- Past presidents display should be chronological and respectful
- Consider timeline or table layout for past presidents
- Maintain visual consistency with homepage hero and content sections
- Ensure proper image aspect ratios and loading states

### Testing Requirements
- Maintain 96%+ test coverage standard from Story 1.2
- Test all data fetching functions with mock Firestore data
- Test component rendering with and without data
- Test responsive behavior across all viewport sizes
- Test accessibility compliance and keyboard navigation
- Test error states and fallback content display

### Performance Considerations
- Optimize board member images with proper sizing and lazy loading
- Consider pagination if board member list becomes very large
- Implement efficient data fetching with proper caching
- Maintain build size optimization from previous stories
