## Dev Notes
### Lessons Learned from Story 1.2
- Modern glass morphism design with sophisticated gradients established
- Comprehensive error handling with production/development modes implemented
- Accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA) and reduced motion support required
- 96%+ test coverage standard established
- Performance optimizations (will-change, smooth scrolling) should be maintained

### Data Models Requirements
[Source: architecture/data-models-and-database-schema.md]
- **content collection**: Use for About Us mission and history content
- **boardMembers collection**: Stores information for each current board member (name, title, bio, imageURL)
- **pastPresidents collection**: Stores a list of past presidents (name, term)

### Component Architecture Guidelines
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- Follow established pattern: components in /src/components/, data fetching in /src/lib/
- Use React Server Components for data fetching and client components for interactivity
- Maintain ShadCN UI design system consistency
- Implement proper TypeScript interfaces in /src/types/

### Navigation Integration
- Add "About" link to existing header navigation
- Consider dropdown or mega-menu if multiple About-related pages needed
- Maintain responsive navigation design from Story 1.1

### Technical Patterns from Story 1.2
- Use same error handling pattern (ErrorFallback component)
- Implement fallback content for offline scenarios
- Follow established animation and styling patterns
- Maintain accessibility features (skip links, ARIA labels, semantic HTML)

### File Locations for New Code
- About page: src/app/about/page.tsx (create new)
- Board data fetching: src/lib/board.ts (create new)
- Past presidents data: src/lib/pastPresidents.ts (create new)
- Board component: src/components/BoardMembersSection.tsx (create new)
- Past presidents component: src/components/PastPresidentsSection.tsx (create new)
- Type definitions: src/types/board.ts, src/types/pastPresidents.ts (create new)

### Design Considerations
- Board member cards should include photos, names, titles, and brief bios
- Past presidents display should be chronological and respectful
- Consider timeline or table layout for past presidents
- Maintain visual consistency with homepage hero and content sections
- Ensure proper image aspect ratios and loading states

### Testing Requirements
- Maintain 96%+ test coverage standard from Story 1.2
- Test all data fetching functions with mock Firestore data
- Test component rendering with and without data
- Test responsive behavior across all viewport sizes
- Test accessibility compliance and keyboard navigation
- Test error states and fallback content display

### Performance Considerations
- Optimize board member images with proper sizing and lazy loading
- Consider pagination if board member list becomes very large
- Implement efficient data fetching with proper caching
- Maintain build size optimization from previous stories
