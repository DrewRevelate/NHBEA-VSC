# Story 6.2: Production Firestore Data Verification and Migration

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** DevOps Engineer,
**I want** to verify that production Firestore data matches the updated conference information and implement automated data migration scripts if discrepancies are found,
**so that** we ensure data integrity, prevent runtime errors, and maintain consistent user experience across development and production environments.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Comprehensive production Firestore database audit is performed to identify data structure discrepancies, missing fields, type inconsistencies, and outdated schema formats across all collections
2. Automated data validation script is created to compare production data against the unified schema definitions with detailed reporting of validation failures and data quality issues
3. Safe data migration scripts are implemented with transaction support, rollback capabilities, and progress tracking to transform existing production data to match updated schemas
4. Production data backup and restore procedures are established with automated backup creation before any migration operations and verified restore capabilities
5. Data migration testing is performed in staging environment with production data snapshots to validate migration scripts and identify potential issues before production deployment
6. Real-time monitoring and alerting is implemented to detect data inconsistencies and schema violations in production with automated notification and recovery procedures
7. Data migration documentation is created with step-by-step procedures, rollback instructions, and troubleshooting guides for production deployment teams
8. Post-migration validation confirms all production data conforms to updated schemas and all application functionality works correctly with migrated data

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Dependencies
This story directly depends on Story 6.1 (Data Model Unification) being completed first, as the production data verification and migration scripts rely on:
- Unified Conference schema from consolidation effort
- Zod validation schemas for all data types  
- Migration utilities and data transformation functions
- Error handling classes for validation failures

### Current Production Environment Analysis

[Source: docs/architecture/9-deployment-and-cicd.md and current git status]

**Firebase Project Configuration**:
- Production Firebase project: NHBEA production environment
- Firestore database: Production collections with V1 migrated data
- Firebase Hosting: Static site deployment with CDN caching
- Cloud Functions: Payment processing and form submission endpoints

**Known Production Data Issues**:
Based on the conflicting Conference interfaces identified in Story 6.1:
- Conference documents may use either the old `dataModels.ts` format or newer `conference.ts` format
- Date fields may be stored as Firestore timestamps vs Date objects
- Location data may be stored as simple strings vs nested address objects
- Registration fees may be stored as single values vs complex fee structures

### Data Migration Architecture Requirements

[Source: docs/architecture/core-backend-components.md#data-migration-jobs]

**Migration Framework Structure**:
```typescript
// Migration framework in /src/lib/production-migration/
export interface MigrationScript {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  version: string;
  dependencies: string[];
  execute(): Promise<MigrationResult>;
  rollback(): Promise<void>;
  validate(): Promise<ValidationResult>;
}

export interface MigrationResult {
  success: boolean;
  documentsProcessed: number;
  documentsUpdated: number;
  errors: MigrationError[];
  duration: number;
  rollbackRequired: boolean;
}
```

**Required Migration Scripts**:
- `001-conference-schema-unification.ts`: Transform conference documents to unified schema
- `002-member-structure-update.ts`: Update member documents with new nested structures
- `003-registrant-reference-validation.ts`: Validate and fix registrant-conference references
- `004-award-category-migration.ts`: Migrate award categories to new structure
- `005-date-field-standardization.ts`: Standardize all date fields to proper formats

### Production Data Validation Strategy

[Source: docs/architecture/core-backend-components.md#logging-monitoring]

**Validation Architecture**:
```typescript
// Production validator in /src/lib/production-validation/
export class ProductionDataValidator {
  async validateCollection(collectionName: string): Promise<ValidationReport>
  async validateDocument(collection: string, docId: string): Promise<DocumentValidation>
  async generateHealthReport(): Promise<DataHealthReport>
  async scheduleValidation(cron: string): Promise<void>
}

export interface ValidationReport {
  collection: string;
  totalDocuments: number;
  validDocuments: number;
  invalidDocuments: number;
  validationErrors: ValidationError[];
  dataQualityScore: number;
  recommendations: string[];
}
```

**Validation Priorities**:
1. **Critical**: Conference data schema consistency for active conferences
2. **High**: Member data integrity for authentication and profile management  
3. **Medium**: Historical data conformance for past presidents and hall of fame
4. **Low**: Legacy data cleanup for deprecated fields and unused collections

### Firestore Backup and Migration Strategy

[Source: docs/architecture/9-deployment-and-cicd.md]

**Backup Requirements**:
```typescript
// Backup utilities in /src/lib/production-backup/
export class FirestoreBackupManager {
  async createSnapshot(collections: string[]): Promise<BackupSnapshot>
  async validateBackup(snapshotId: string): Promise<BackupValidation>
  async restoreFromSnapshot(snapshotId: string, collections?: string[]): Promise<RestoreResult>
  async scheduleBackups(schedule: BackupSchedule): Promise<void>
}

export interface BackupSnapshot {
  id: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  collections: string[];
  documentCount: number;
  sizeBytes: number;
  checksums: Map<string, string>;
}
```

**Backup Strategy**:
- **Pre-migration**: Full database snapshot with validation
- **During migration**: Incremental backups at each major step
- **Post-migration**: Validation snapshot for rollback reference
- **Retention**: 7 days for migration backups, 30 days for scheduled backups

### Production Monitoring and Alerting

[Source: docs/architecture/core-backend-components.md#monitoring-strategy]

**Real-time Monitoring Requirements**:
```typescript
// Monitoring system in /src/lib/production-monitoring/
export class DataIntegrityMonitor {
  async checkSchemaCompliance(): Promise<ComplianceReport>
  async monitorDataChanges(): Promise<void>
  async alertOnViolations(violations: SchemaViolation[]): Promise<void>
  async generateTrendReport(): Promise<TrendAnalysis>
}

export interface SchemaViolation {
  collection: string;
  documentId: string;
  field: string;
  expectedType: string;
  actualValue: any;
  severity: 'critical' | 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
  detectedAt: Date;
}
```

**Alert Escalation**:
- **Critical**: Schema violations preventing application functionality - immediate alert
- **High**: Data inconsistencies affecting user experience - 15-minute escalation
- **Medium**: Data quality issues requiring attention - daily summary
- **Low**: Minor formatting inconsistencies - weekly report

### Error Handling and Recovery

[Source: docs/architecture/core-backend-components.md#error-handling-strategy]

**Migration Error Classes**:
```typescript
export class MigrationError extends AppError {
  constructor(
    message: string,
    public migrationId: string,
    public documentId?: string,
    public recoverable: boolean = true
  ) {
    super('MIGRATION_ERROR', message, 500);
  }
}

export class DataValidationError extends AppError {
  constructor(
    message: string,
    public collection: string,
    public documentId: string,
    public field: string,
    public expectedType: string
  ) {
    super('DATA_VALIDATION_ERROR', message, 422);
  }
}
```

**Recovery Procedures**:
1. **Automatic Recovery**: Safe data coercion and format correction
2. **Manual Review**: Complex data inconsistencies requiring human decision
3. **Rollback Triggers**: Critical errors requiring full migration reversal
4. **Emergency Procedures**: Complete system rollback to last known good state

### Performance Considerations

[Source: docs/architecture/core-backend-components.md#database-query-optimization]

**Migration Performance Optimization**:
- **Batch Processing**: Process documents in batches of 500 to avoid timeout issues
- **Parallel Processing**: Use Promise.all for independent collection migrations
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates with estimated completion time
- **Resource Monitoring**: Track memory usage and Firestore quota consumption
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect Firestore write limits to avoid quota exhaustion

**Performance Targets**:
- Migration Speed: >1000 documents per minute for simple transformations
- Downtime: <15 minutes for critical migrations during maintenance window
- Validation Speed: Complete database validation in <30 minutes
- Rollback Time: <10 minutes for emergency rollback procedures

### Integration with CI/CD Pipeline

**Deployment Integration**:
- Migration scripts integrated into deployment pipeline
- Automated staging validation before production deployment
- Blue-green deployment support for zero-downtime migrations
- Automated rollback triggers based on application health checks

**Staging Environment Requirements**:
- Production data snapshot refresh weekly
- Automated migration testing on every deployment
- Performance baseline comparison with production
- Full application functionality testing with migrated data

## Testing

**Test File Locations**: Production data verification and migration tests will be implemented in `/src/lib/__tests__/production-migration/` directory with integration into existing Jest testing framework

**Testing Framework Integration**:
- **Migration Script Tests**: Unit tests for each migration script with mock data scenarios
- **Validation Tests**: Comprehensive testing of production data validation logic
- **Backup/Restore Tests**: Integration tests for backup and restore functionality
- **End-to-End Tests**: Full migration pipeline testing with real data samples
