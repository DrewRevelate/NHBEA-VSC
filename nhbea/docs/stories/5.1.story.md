## Dev Notes

### Previous Epic Context
Building upon the complete Epic 4 conservative royal blue brand implementation:
- **Foundation CSS System (Story 4.1)**: Design token architecture and brand color system implemented
- **Typography Hierarchy (Story 4.2)**: Inter + Georgia font system with responsive scaling
- **Core Component Transformation (Story 4.3)**: Buttons, navigation, forms, and cards with brand consistency
- **Page-Level Brand Application (Story 4.4)**: All major pages transformed with cohesive brand experience
- **Brand Validation & Testing (Story 4.5)**: Comprehensive testing framework and quality assurance protocols

Story 5.1 serves as the foundational audit and planning phase that will identify structural inconsistencies and establish standardization requirements for subsequent Epic 5 stories focused on implementation and optimization.

### Current Site Architecture Analysis

[Source: docs/architecture/core-backend-components.md]

**Frontend Framework Requirements**:
- **Next.js 14+**: App Router with static export compatibility for consistent routing patterns
- **TypeScript**: Type safety and consistent component interfaces across all pages
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling with design token integration for brand consistency
- **React 18+**: Server Components and Suspense patterns for consistent loading states

**Current Page Structure Patterns Identified**:

**Homepage (`/src/app/page.tsx`)**:
- Uses Suspense wrapper with loading spinner for consistent async handling
- Implements ErrorFallback component for development vs production error display
- Includes structured main content with semantic HTML (`<main id="main-content">`)
- Uses default/fallback content pattern for graceful degradation

**About Page (`/src/app/about/page.tsx`)**:
- Includes comprehensive metadata with Next.js Metadata API
- Implements dual data fetching strategy (enhanced + legacy board members)
- Uses consistent ErrorFallback pattern but different main content ID (`about-main-content`)
- Complex data transformation logic between enhanced and legacy formats

**Conference Page (`/src/app/conference/page.tsx`)**:
- Most complex page with dynamic metadata generation and structured data (JSON-LD)
- Implements ConferenceThemeProvider for context-aware theming
- Uses comprehensive error handling with graceful fallback for missing conference data
- Includes advanced features like registration availability checking and pricing logic

### Structural Inconsistencies Identified

**Hero Section Patterns**:
- Homepage: Uses `HeroSection` component with content props
- About: Uses `AboutHeroSection` component (potentially static content)
- Conference: Uses `ShapingTheFutureHero` within `ConferenceThemeProvider`
- **Inconsistency**: Different hero components and prop patterns across pages

**Main Content Structure**:
- Homepage: `<main id="main-content">` with tabIndex={-1}
- About: `<main id="about-main-content">` with tabIndex={-1}
- Conference: No explicit main element wrapping (relies on sections)
- **Inconsistency**: Different main element IDs and structural approaches

**Error Handling Patterns**:
- All pages use similar `ErrorFallback` component but implementation varies
- Development vs production display logic is repeated across pages
- Error state positioning and styling inconsistent
- **Inconsistency**: Duplicate error handling logic with slight variations

**Loading State Management**:
- Homepage: Uses Suspense with `LoadingSpinner` component
- About: Uses same pattern but different component implementations
- Conference: Complex loading for multiple data sources without unified pattern
- **Inconsistency**: Different loading component implementations and patterns

**Metadata Implementation**:
- Homepage: No explicit metadata export (relies on root layout)
- About: Comprehensive static metadata with Next.js Metadata API
- Conference: Dynamic metadata generation with OpenGraph and Twitter cards
- **Inconsistency**: Different metadata strategies and completeness levels

### Component Architecture Assessment

**Reusable Components Identified**:
- `ErrorFallback`: Used across multiple pages but with implementation differences
- `LoadingSpinner`: Similar implementations but not shared component
- Hero sections: Multiple variants that could be consolidated into flexible component
- Content sections: Repeated patterns that could benefit from standardization

**Brand Integration Patterns**:
- Conservative royal blue design tokens implemented via CSS custom properties
- Consistent button and form styling through Tailwind utility classes
- Card components use consistent brand styling patterns
- Navigation and footer components maintain brand consistency

### Architecture Requirements for Standardization

[Source: docs/architecture/core-backend-components.md#data-access-layer]

**Repository Pattern Implementation**:
