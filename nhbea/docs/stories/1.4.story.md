## Dev Notes
### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.3 and Comprehensive Review Analysis:
- Glass morphism design with sophisticated gradients established and should be maintained
- Comprehensive error handling with production/development modes implemented
- Accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA) and reduced motion support required
- **Quality Standard Established**: 96%+ test coverage is now expected (Story 1.2: 96.29%, Story 1.3: 100%)
- Performance optimizations (will-change, smooth scrolling) should be maintained
- Server Components architecture pattern established in src/lib/ for data fetching

### Critical Technical Debt from Review (Story 1.3 Impact)
**Homepage Content Regression Issue**: Discovered critical issue where Firestore content fetching fails during static generation, causing `$undefined` placeholders. This affects static export compatibility.
- **Root Cause**: Firestore integration conflicts with Next.js static export during build
- **Impact on Story 1.4**: Newsletter form must be resilient to static generation issues
- **Mitigation Required**: Implement robust fallback content and error handling strategies
- **Resolution Path**: Use client-side rendering for dynamic forms or ensure proper SSR fallbacks

### Data Models Requirements
[Source: architecture/data-models-and-database-schema.md]
- **newsletterSubscribers collection**: Stores emails from the newsletter signup form
  - Document structure should include: email, timestamp, status
  - Use email as document ID to prevent duplicates

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form (Latest) - Managing form state and validation
- **Validation**: Zod (Latest) - Schema validation for robust, type-safe data validation
- **Backend**: Firebase (Latest) - Database operations via Firestore
- **UI Components**: ShadCN UI (Latest) - Accessible, unstyled component primitives
- **Testing**: Jest & RTL (Latest) - Unit & integration testing

### Component Architecture Guidelines
[Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- Components organized by feature or as shared UI elements within /src/components/
- All components built with React and TypeScript, using ShadCN UI as a base
- Component-level state managed with React Hooks (useState, useReducer)
- Server state (data from Firestore) managed via React Server Components and data fetching functions in /src/lib/

### Backend Architecture Guidelines
[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]
- Database interactions performed through functions in /src/lib/
- Use Firebase Admin SDK for server-side operations (form submissions requiring admin privileges)
- Server-side logic implemented as Next.js Server Actions
- Keep logic co-located with components that use it

### File Locations for New Code
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- Newsletter component: src/components/NewsletterSignup.tsx (create new)
- Newsletter data functions: src/lib/newsletter.ts (create new)
- Type definitions: src/types/newsletter.ts (create new)
- Test files: src/components/NewsletterSignup.test.tsx, src/lib/newsletter.test.ts (create new)

### Design Considerations
- Maintain glass morphism design consistency from previous stories
- Form should be unobtrusive but visible - consider footer placement for site-wide access
- Success message should be clear and professional
- Loading states should use established animation patterns
- Mobile-first responsive design following established breakpoints

### Testing Requirements
Testing Standards from Previous Stories:
- Testing framework: Jest & React Testing Library (RTL)
- Create test files alongside components with .test.tsx extension
- Focus on unit and integration testing for form validation and Firestore operations
- Test accessibility compliance and responsive behavior
- Maintain 96%+ test coverage standard established in previous stories
- Test error states, success states, and edge cases

### Technical Constraints
- Must use existing Firebase configuration from Story 1.1
- Follow established project structure with src/ directory
- Use ShadCN UI components as base for consistent styling
- Ensure all new code follows TypeScript best practices
- Maintain responsive design principles and accessibility standards
- Server Actions for form submission to leverage serverless architecture
- **Critical**: Implement form as Client Component to avoid static generation issues experienced in Story 1.3
- **Quality Gate**: Must achieve 96%+ test coverage to meet established quality standards

### Content Management Workflow Considerations
Based on comprehensive review findings:
- **Static Generation Challenges**: Newsletter form should use client-side rendering to avoid Firestore/static export conflicts
- **Error Handling Requirements**: Must implement graceful degradation when Firestore operations fail
- **Validation Strategy**: Include both client-side (Zod) and server-side validation for data integrity
- **FireCMS Integration**: Consider how newsletter subscribers will be managed/viewed through FireCMS
