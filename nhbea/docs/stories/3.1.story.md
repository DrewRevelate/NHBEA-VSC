# Story 3.1: Conference Registration and Payment

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** Visitor,
**I want** to learn about the annual conference and pay the registration fee online,
**so that** I can easily sign up for the event.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A "Conference" page is created that displays details for the active conference, fetched from Firestore.
2. The page includes a registration form to collect attendee information.
3. Upon submission, the system generates a Square payment link for the conference fee.
4. The user is redirected to the Square hosted checkout page to complete payment.
5. The system includes a confirmation page to verify the transaction was successful.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.1 and 2.2, key patterns established:
- **Form Implementation**: React Hook Form + Zod validation pattern is proven and should be reused
- **Payment Integration**: Square payment link generation pattern established in src/lib/payments.ts
- **API Strategy**: Use API routes (not Server Actions) for static export compatibility
- **Wrapper Pattern**: Client-side wrapper components for proper form boundary handling
- **Type Safety**: Strong TypeScript patterns with proper type definitions in `/src/types/`
- **Security**: Never handle card data directly, use Square hosted checkout
- **Testing Standards**: 90%+ coverage requirement with Jest & RTL

### Data Models Requirements
[Source: architecture/core-backend-components.md#data-models]
Conference and Registrant models already exist in `/src/types/conference.ts`:
- **Conference model**: title, schedule, location, registrationSettings, pricingTiers
- **Registrant model**: personalInfo, paymentStatus, registrationType, preferences
- **Registration types**: 'regular' | 'early_bird' | 'student' | 'speaker'
- **Payment statuses**: 'pending' | 'paid' | 'refunded' | 'cancelled'

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/architecture-style.md#tech-stack]
- **Payment Processing**: Square API v2 (already integrated in project)
- **Form Management**: React Hook Form (Latest) - established pattern
- **Validation**: Zod (Latest) - already integrated
- **Framework**: Next.js ~14.x with API routes for form processing
- **Database**: Cloud Firestore - conference and registrants collections
- **Testing**: Jest & RTL (Latest) - established testing patterns

### Backend Architecture Guidelines
[Source: architecture/core-backend-components.md#api-layer-strategy]
- **API Routes**: Use for payment processing (webhook compatibility)
- **Repository Pattern**: All database operations through `/src/lib/conference.ts`
- **Error Handling**: Use established apiHandler pattern for consistent responses
- **Caching**: Conference data cached for 1 minute (CACHE_TIMES.CONFERENCE: 60)

### File Locations for New Code
[Source: architecture/architecture-style.md#unified-project-structure]
- **API Route**: `/src/app/api/conference/route.ts`
- **Components**: `/src/components/ConferenceRegistrationForm.tsx`
- **Validation**: `/src/lib/conferenceValidation.ts`
- **Pages**: `/src/app/conference/` directory structure
- **Types**: Already exist in `/src/types/conference.ts`
- **Repository**: Extend `/src/lib/conference.ts`
- **Tests**: Co-located `.test.tsx` files

### Payment Integration Requirements
[Source: architecture/10-security.md#payment-security]
- **PCI Compliance**: SAQ A level - redirect to Square hosted pages
- **Security**: Never store or handle credit card information
- **Webhook Security**: Signature verification using HMAC SHA-256
- **Rate Limiting**: 10 requests per hour for conference registration
- **Environment Variables**: Use existing SQUARE_* credentials

### Form Validation Requirements
[Source: Previous Story Implementation]
- **Phone Validation**: `/^[\+]?[1]?[\s\-\.]?[\(]?[\d]{3}[\)]?[\s\-\.]?[\d]{3}[\s\-\.]?[\d]{4}$/`
- **Email Validation**: Zod's built-in email validator
- **US States**: Validation list available in membershipValidation.ts
- **Input Sanitization**: Remove scripts, limit to 1000 chars

### API Response Formats
[Source: architecture/8-rest-api-specifications.md#response-formats]
Success Response:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "registrationId": "reg_123",
    "paymentUrl": "https://square.link/...",
    "amount": 75.00,
    "currency": "USD"
  }
}
```

Error Response:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Invalid request data",
    "details": { "fields": { "email": ["Invalid email format"] } }
  }
}
```

### Security Considerations
[Source: architecture/10-security.md]
- **Input Sanitization**: Sanitize all user inputs including preferences
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement 10 req/hour limit for registration endpoint
- **HTTPS Only**: All payment-related endpoints must use HTTPS
- **Environment Security**: Square credentials in environment variables only

### Technical Constraints
- Must maintain existing Firebase configuration and architecture
- Cannot break existing functionality from Epic 1 and Epic 2
- Must maintain design consistency with established component patterns
- Static export functionality must be preserved
- Performance optimizations must be maintained
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance must be preserved

## Testing

**Test File Locations**: Co-located `.test.tsx` and `.test.ts` files alongside components
**Test Standards**: Jest & React Testing Library following patterns from Epic 2
**Testing Frameworks**: 
- Jest for unit testing
- React Testing Library for component testing
- Mock Square API responses for payment testing
- Supertest for API endpoint testing (if needed)
**Specific Testing Requirements**:
- Form validation testing with invalid inputs
- Conference registration Firestore integration testing
- Payment workflow testing with mocked Square responses
- User flow testing from registration to confirmation
- Error handling testing for payment failures
- Accessibility testing for form components
- Pricing tier calculation testing
- Different registration type testing (early_bird, regular, student, speaker)
- Rate limiting testing for API endpoint
