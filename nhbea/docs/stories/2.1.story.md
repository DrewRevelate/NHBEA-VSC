## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.4 and 1.5, key patterns established:
- **Form Validation**: Zod validation patterns are established with comprehensive error handling
- **React Hook Form**: Successfully implemented for newsletter signup, pattern can be extended
- **Component Testing**: Comprehensive testing patterns established with Jest & RTL
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling patterns for API failures and validation
- **Type Safety**: Strong TypeScript patterns with proper type definitions in `/src/types/`

### Data Models Requirements
[Source: architecture/data-models-and-database-schema.md]
- No specific professional member collection mentioned in current schema
- May need to extend data model or create new collection for membership applications
- Existing patterns from newsletterSubscribers can inform membership data structure

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Payment Processing**: Square API v2 for secure payment handling
- **Form Management**: React Hook Form (Latest) - already established in project
- **Validation**: Zod (Latest) - already integrated and proven in Story 1.5
- **Framework**: Next.js ~14.x with Server Actions for payment link generation
- **Testing**: Jest & RTL (Latest) - established testing patterns available

### Backend Architecture Guidelines
[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]
- **Server Actions**: Payment link generation must use Next.js Server Actions
- **Data Access**: Database interactions through functions in `/src/lib/`
- **API Integration**: Square payment links created server-side for security

### File Locations for New Code
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- **Components**: `/src/components/ProfessionalMembershipForm.tsx`
- **Types**: `/src/types/membership.ts` for membership-related type definitions
- **Library Functions**: `/src/lib/payments.ts` for Square API integration
- **Pages**: `/src/app/membership/professional/page.tsx` and related pages
- **Tests**: Co-located `.test.tsx` files following established patterns

### Payment Integration Requirements
[Source: architecture/security.md, backend-architecture.md]
- **Security**: All payments handled by Square's hosted checkout pages
- **PCI Compliance**: Application never handles credit card information
- **Server Actions**: Payment link generation must be server-side
- **Error Handling**: Proper handling of Square API failures and edge cases

### Form Validation Requirements
[Source: Previous Story Implementation]
- **Client-side Validation**: Use React Hook Form with Zod resolver
- **Real-time Validation**: Field-level validation with user-friendly error messages
- **Schema Validation**: Comprehensive Zod schemas for type safety
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of validation failures

### Square API Integration Considerations
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md, security.md]
- **API Version**: Square API v2 for payment processing
- **Hosted Checkout**: Users redirected to Square's secure checkout pages
- **Return URLs**: Success/failure redirects back to NHBEA application
- **Environment Configuration**: Separate sandbox/production configurations needed

### Testing Requirements
[Source: Established patterns from Story 1.4/1.5]
Testing framework: Jest & React Testing Library (RTL)
- **Unit Tests**: All form components, validation functions, payment integration
- **Integration Tests**: Full membership application flow
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain 90%+ coverage established in previous stories
- **Error Scenarios**: Test validation failures, API errors, edge cases
- **Mock Integration**: Mock Square API for testing environments

### Technical Constraints
- Must maintain existing Firebase configuration and architecture
- Cannot break existing functionality from Epic 1
- Must maintain design consistency with established component patterns
- Static export functionality must be preserved
- Performance optimizations must be maintained
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance must be preserved

### Security Considerations
[Source: architecture/security.md]
- **Payment Security**: Never store or handle credit card information
- **Data Validation**: Server-side validation of all form submissions
- **API Security**: Secure handling of Square API credentials
- **Input Sanitization**: Proper sanitization of all user inputs

## Testing
**Test File Locations**: Co-located `.test.tsx` files alongside components
**Test Standards**: Jest & React Testing Library following patterns from Epic 1
**Testing Frameworks**: 
- Jest for unit testing
- React Testing Library for component testing
- Mock Square API responses for integration testing
**Specific Testing Requirements**:
- Form validation testing with invalid inputs
- Payment integration testing with mocked Square API
- User flow testing from form submission to payment completion
- Error handling testing for API failures
- Accessibility testing for form components

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-07-28

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment: EXCELLENT** - The implementation demonstrates high-quality, production-ready code with comprehensive validation, proper error handling, and excellent test coverage. The developer followed all architectural guidance and established patterns from Epic 1.

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive form validation with Zod schemas
- Proper separation of concerns with wrapper pattern for client/server boundary
- Excellent accessibility implementation (ARIA labels, error messages, semantic HTML)
- Robust error handling throughout the payment workflow
- Clean, maintainable code structure following established patterns
- Full TypeScript coverage with proper type safety
