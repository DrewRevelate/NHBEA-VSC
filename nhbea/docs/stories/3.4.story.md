## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
Building upon Story 3.1 (Conference Registration and Payment) which established:
- **Base Conference Page**: Comprehensive conference display with registration integration
- **Data Architecture**: Conference and Registrant data models in Firestore
- **Payment Integration**: Square payment processing for registration fees
- **Component Patterns**: Established design system and responsive layouts
- **API Architecture**: API routes for form processing and payment handling

### Technical Architecture Requirements
[Source: nhbea/docs/architecture/]
- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js 14+ with App Router (already established)
- **Database**: Cloud Firestore with existing conference collection structure
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with ShadCN/ui components (consistent with existing)
- **Performance**: Maintain <3 second initial load times
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance (continue existing standards)

### Data Model Extensions Required
New Firestore collections/documents needed:
- `conferences/{conferenceId}/speakers` - Speaker profiles and session assignments
- `conferences/{conferenceId}/agenda` - Detailed session schedule and tracks
- `conferences/{conferenceId}/faqs` - Frequently asked questions by category
- `conferences/{conferenceId}/venue` - Enhanced venue information and amenities
- `conferences/{conferenceId}/settings` - Theme colors, social media, and configuration

### External API Integrations
- **Google Maps API**: For venue location and directions functionality
- **Twitter/X API**: For social media feed integration (if credentials available)
- **Instagram Basic Display API**: For photo gallery integration (optional)

### Component Architecture
New components to be created in `/src/components/`:
- `ConferenceAgenda.tsx` - Interactive agenda with filtering and session details
- `SpeakersSection.tsx` - Featured speakers showcase with modal bios
- `VenueInformation.tsx` - Interactive venue details with map integration
- `ConferenceFAQ.tsx` - Expandable FAQ section with search
- `SocialMediaFeed.tsx` - Conference social media integration
- `ConferenceTheme.tsx` - Dynamic theming based on conference settings

### File Structure for New Code
[Source: architecture/architecture-style.md#unified-project-structure]
- **Pages**: Extend existing `/src/app/conference/page.tsx`
- **Components**: `/src/components/` directory for new conference components
- **Libraries**: Extend `/src/lib/conference.ts` with new data fetching functions
- **Types**: Extend `/src/types/conference.ts` with new TypeScript interfaces
- **Styles**: Maintain Tailwind CSS patterns established in existing components

### Security Considerations
- **API Keys**: Secure storage of Google Maps and social media API keys in environment variables
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for external API calls
- **Content Validation**: Sanitize all user-generated content in FAQ submissions
- **Image Optimization**: Secure handling and optimization of speaker photos

### Performance Requirements
- **Image Optimization**: Next.js Image component for speaker photos and venue images
- **Lazy Loading**: Implement lazy loading for non-critical sections (FAQ, speakers)
- **Caching Strategy**: Cache external API responses appropriately
- **Bundle Optimization**: Code splitting for social media integrations

### Technical Constraints
- Must maintain compatibility with existing conference registration workflow
- Cannot break existing Story 3.1 functionality
- Must preserve existing Firebase architecture and security rules
- Static export functionality must be maintained where applicable
- All new features must work without JavaScript for core content (progressive enhancement)

## Testing

**Test File Locations**: Co-located `.test.tsx` and `.test.ts` files alongside new components
**Test Standards**: Jest & React Testing Library following existing patterns

**Testing Frameworks**: 
- Jest for unit testing
- React Testing Library for component testing
- Cypress for end-to-end user flow testing
- Lighthouse for performance and accessibility testing

**Specific Testing Requirements**:
- Speaker profile component rendering and modal functionality
- Agenda filtering and session detail interactions
- FAQ search and expand/collapse functionality
- Mobile responsiveness across all new components
- Social media feed integration (with mocked API responses)
- Google Maps integration testing
- SEO metadata validation
- Accessibility testing for all interactive elements
- Performance testing for image loading and external API calls
- Cross-browser compatibility testing

**Performance Testing Thresholds**:
- Lighthouse Performance Score: > 90
- First Contentful Paint: < 2.5s
- Largest Contentful Paint: < 4s
- Cumulative Layout Shift: < 0.1
