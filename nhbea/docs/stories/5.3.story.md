# Story 5.3: About Page Migration to Standardized Components

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** Front-end Developer and Site Administrator,
**I want** the About page migrated to use the standardized component architecture established in Story 5.2,
**so that** the About page provides consistent user experience, improved maintainability, and follows the unified design patterns established across the site.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. About page is successfully migrated from custom layout to StandardPageLayout component while maintaining all existing functionality and visual design consistency
2. AboutHeroSection is replaced with FlexibleHero component using the 'about' variant with proper professional presentation, leadership focus, and board member highlights
3. All page sections are wrapped with StandardErrorBoundary components providing consistent error handling with retry mechanisms and graceful degradation for data loading failures
4. Custom loading states are replaced with standardized LoadingSpinner and LoadingSkeleton components with appropriate variants for different content sections
5. Page content is reorganized using ResponsiveGrid system with proper spacing, alignment, and responsive breakpoint behavior matching the homepage implementation
6. SEO metadata integration is implemented using StandardPageLayout's meta prop system for consistent OpenGraph, Twitter Card, and structured data implementation
7. Accessibility compliance is maintained and enhanced through StandardPageLayout's built-in features including skip links, ARIA landmarks, focus management, and keyboard navigation
8. Performance optimizations are implemented including code splitting for non-critical sections, lazy loading of heavy components, and maintaining or improving bundle size metrics

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
Story 5.2 established the complete standardized component architecture foundation with outstanding results:
- StandardPageLayout component (125 lines) with hero integration, error boundaries, loading states, and accessibility features
- FlexibleHero component system (408 lines) with 6 variants including the 'about' variant needed for this story
- StandardErrorBoundary (156 lines) with comprehensive error handling and retry mechanisms
- LoadingSpinner & LoadingSkeleton (99 lines) with size and content type variants
- ResponsiveGrid system (127 lines) with breakpoint configuration and typography utilities
- Homepage successfully migrated as reference implementation with maintained 5.93 kB bundle size
- Complete documentation suite with migration guide, API reference, and testing procedures

Key implementation achievements from Story 5.2 that inform this story:
- 85.71% test coverage with comprehensive testing strategies
- Performance optimized with lazy loading and code splitting patterns
- Full WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance with proper semantic HTML
- Brand consistency maintained through Epic 4 design system integration

### Current About Page Analysis
The About page currently uses a custom layout structure with:
- AboutHeroSection component (needs replacement with FlexibleHero variant='about')
- Custom error handling with ErrorFallback component (replace with StandardErrorBoundary)
- Custom LoadingSpinner implementation (replace with standardized LoadingSpinner)
- Manual main content wrapper (replace with StandardPageLayout)
- Multiple content sections that need ResponsiveGrid layout implementation
- Dual API approach for board members (enhanced and legacy) that must be preserved

### Standardized Component Architecture Implementation
[Source: Story 5.2 completion notes and docs/components/migration-guide.md]

**Proven Implementation Patterns from Story 5.2:**
- StandardPageLayout component (125 lines) - production-ready with comprehensive hero integration
- FlexibleHero component system (408 lines) - 'about' variant fully implemented and tested
- StandardErrorBoundary (156 lines) - comprehensive error handling with retry mechanisms
- ResponsiveGrid system (127 lines) - flexible breakpoint configuration with typography utilities
- Performance optimization patterns with lazy loading and code splitting established

**FlexibleHero About Variant Configuration:**
```typescript
// Based on Story 5.2 implementation - FlexibleHero.tsx lines 180-220
hero={{
  component: FlexibleHero,
  props: {
    variant: 'about',
    title: 'About NHBEA',
    subtitle: 'Dedicated to advancing business education throughout New Hampshire since 1960',
    boardCount: boardMembers?.length || 15,
    establishedYear: 1960
  }
}}
```

**StandardPageLayout Configuration:**
```typescript
// Based on Story 5.2 homepage implementation - page.tsx lines 45-60
<StandardPageLayout
  hero={{ component: FlexibleHero, props: aboutHeroProps }}
  error={{ boundary: true }}
  loading={{ enabled: true }}
  meta={{
    title: 'About - NHBEA',
    description: 'Learn about our mission, values, and leadership team committed to advancing business education in New Hampshire',
    openGraph: true,
    twitterCard: true
  }}
  className="min-h-screen"
>
```

**ResponsiveGrid Implementation:**
```typescript
// Based on Story 5.2 homepage patterns - use consistent spacing
<ResponsiveGrid gap="lg" className="space-y-16 md:space-y-20">
  {/* Content sections */}
</ResponsiveGrid>
```

### Data Model Requirements
[Source: current About page implementation analysis]

The About page handles multiple data sources:
- Homepage content via getHomepageContent() for mission and about content
- Board members via getBoardMembers() (enhanced API) with fallback to getLegacyBoardMembers()
- Past presidents via getPastPresidents() with default fallback data
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing data structures

### File Structure Requirements
[Source: Story 5.2 implementation patterns and docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

**Target file location:** `/src/app/about/page.tsx` (modify existing)

**Component imports needed (verified from Story 5.2):**
```typescript
// Standardized components from Story 5.2 implementation
import { StandardPageLayout } from '@/components/StandardPageLayout'
import { FlexibleHero } from '@/components/FlexibleHero'
import { StandardErrorBoundary } from '@/components/StandardErrorBoundary'
import { ResponsiveGrid } from '@/components/ResponsiveGrid'
import { LoadingSpinner, LoadingSkeleton } from '@/components/LoadingSpinner'
```

**Components to remove imports:**
- AboutHeroSection (replaced by FlexibleHero with variant='about')
- Custom LoadingSpinner function (replaced by standardized LoadingSpinner component)
- Custom ErrorFallback function (replaced by StandardErrorBoundary)

**Lazy Loading Imports (following Story 5.2 patterns):**
```typescript
// Non-critical sections should be lazy loaded
const HeritageSection = lazy(() => import('@/components/HeritageSection'))
const ValuesImpactSection = lazy(() => import('@/components/ValuesImpactSection'))
const LeadershipOverviewSection = lazy(() => import('@/components/LeadershipOverviewSection'))
```

### Performance Requirements
[Source: Story 5.2 completion notes]

- Maintain or improve current bundle size metrics
- Implement code splitting for below-the-fold sections (HeritageSection, ValuesImpactSection, LeadershipOverviewSection)
- Use lazy loading patterns established in homepage migration
- Target Core Web Vitals: LCP <2.5s, FID <100ms, CLS <0.1

### Error Handling Strategy
[Source: docs/components/StandardErrorBoundary.md]

Replace manual error state management with StandardErrorBoundary:
- Wrap each major section (mission, heritage, values, leadership, board, presidents) individually
- Configure with appropriate retry mechanisms for data-dependent sections
- Maintain development vs production error display patterns
- Preserve existing console logging for debugging

### Accessibility Requirements
[Source: docs/components/StandardPageLayout.md]

StandardPageLayout provides:
- Skip links automatically configured
- Proper ARIA landmarks and focus management
- Semantic HTML structure with main content area
- Keyboard navigation support

Must preserve existing accessibility features and enhance where possible.

## Testing

**Test File Locations:** Based on Story 5.2 testing patterns in `/src/__tests__/components/` and `/__tests__/e2e/` directories.

**Testing Framework Integration (from Story 5.2 success):**
- **Unit Testing**: Jest and React Testing Library with 85%+ coverage target
- **Integration Testing**: Component interaction testing with proper prop validation
- **Visual Regression Testing**: Playwright with existing component-visual-regression.spec.ts
- **Accessibility Testing**: axe-core integration via accessibility-compliance.spec.ts
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Comprehensive testing workflow already established

**Specific Testing Requirements:**
- **About Page Migration Testing**: Verify all existing functionality preserved after standardized component migration
- **FlexibleHero About Variant**: Test 'about' variant rendering with dynamic board count and established year props
- **Error Boundary Integration**: Test StandardErrorBoundary behavior with simulated API failures for board/presidents data
- **Loading State Testing**: Test LoadingSpinner and LoadingSkeleton components with network throttling scenarios
- **ResponsiveGrid Testing**: Validate breakpoint behavior and spacing consistency across all device sizes
- **Accessibility Compliance**: Keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- **SEO Metadata Testing**: OpenGraph, Twitter Card, and structured data implementation validation
- **Performance Regression**: Bundle size monitoring and Core Web Vitals metrics (LCP <2.5s, FID <100ms, CLS <0.1)

**Visual Regression Testing:**
Extend existing Playwright test suite (`/__tests__/e2e/component-visual-regression.spec.ts`) to include About page scenarios.

**Integration Testing:**
Leverage established CI/CD pipeline (`.github/workflows/standardized-components-testing.yml`) for automated testing integration.
