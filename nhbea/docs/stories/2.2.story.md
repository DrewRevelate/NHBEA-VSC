## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.1, key patterns established:
- **Form Validation**: Zod validation patterns are established with comprehensive error handling
- **React Hook Form**: Successfully implemented for membership forms, pattern can be extended
- **Component Testing**: Comprehensive testing patterns established with Jest & RTL
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling patterns for API failures and validation
- **Type Safety**: Strong TypeScript patterns with proper type definitions in `/src/types/`
- **API Routes**: Use API routes over Server Actions for static export compatibility
- **Wrapper Pattern**: Client-side wrapper components for proper form boundary handling
- **File Structure**: Established patterns in `/src/types/membership.ts`, `/src/lib/*Validation.ts`, `/src/components/*Form.tsx`

### Data Models Requirements
[Source: architecture.md#studentApplicants]
The studentApplicants collection stores student membership applications for board review with the following schema:
- `personalInfo` (map): {firstName, lastName, email, phone}
- `academicInfo` (map): {institution, major, graduationYear, gpa}
- `essay` (string): Application essay
- `references` (array): List of references
- `submittedAt` (timestamp): Application date
- `status` (enum): pending|approved|rejected
- `reviewNotes` (string): Board review comments

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture.md#tech-stack]
- **Form Management**: React Hook Form (Latest) - already established in project
- **Validation**: Zod (Latest) - already integrated and proven in Story 2.1
- **Framework**: Next.js ~14.x with API routes for form processing
- **Database**: Cloud Firestore - studentApplicants collection
- **Testing**: Jest & RTL (Latest) - established testing patterns available

### Backend Architecture Guidelines
[Source: architecture/core-backend-components.md#api-layer-strategy]
- **Form Submissions**: Use API routes for static export compatibility (learned from Story 2.1)
- **Data Access**: Database interactions through repository functions in `/src/lib/`
- **Firestore Integration**: Direct writes to studentApplicants collection for board review

### File Locations for New Code
[Source: architecture.md#unified-project-structure]
- **Components**: `/src/components/StudentMembershipForm.tsx`
- **Types**: Extend `/src/types/membership.ts` for student-related type definitions
- **Library Functions**: `/src/lib/studentApplications.ts` for Firestore integration
- **Pages**: `/src/app/membership/student/page.tsx` and related pages
- **Tests**: Co-located `.test.tsx` files following established patterns

### Form Validation Requirements
[Source: Previous Story Implementation and architecture.md]
- **Client-side Validation**: Use React Hook Form with Zod resolver
- **Real-time Validation**: Field-level validation with user-friendly error messages
- **Schema Validation**: Comprehensive Zod schemas for type safety
- **Essay Validation**: Required essay field with minimum length requirements
- **Academic Info Validation**: GPA validation, graduation year validation
- **Reference Validation**: Array validation for reference contacts

### Firestore Security Rules
[Source: architecture.md#firestore-security-rules-considerations]
- **studentApplicants collection**: Client write access (create only) for application submissions
- **No direct client writes except**: studentApplicants (create only) as specified in architecture
- **Board Review Access**: Admin SDK access for board members to review applications

### Testing Requirements
[Source: Established patterns from Story 2.1]
Testing framework: Jest & React Testing Library (RTL)
- **Unit Tests**: All form components, validation functions, Firestore integration
- **Integration Tests**: Full student application submission flow
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain 90%+ coverage established in previous stories
- **Error Scenarios**: Test validation failures, Firestore errors, edge cases
- **Mock Integration**: Mock Firestore for testing environments

### Technical Constraints
- Must maintain existing Firebase configuration and architecture
- Cannot break existing functionality from Epic 1 and Story 2.1
- Must maintain design consistency with established component patterns
- Static export functionality must be preserved
- Performance optimizations must be maintained
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance must be preserved

### Security Considerations
[Source: architecture/10-security.md]
- **Data Validation**: Server-side validation of all form submissions
- **Input Sanitization**: Proper sanitization of all user inputs including essay content
- **Collection Security**: Firestore rules for studentApplicants create-only access

## Testing

**Test File Locations**: Co-located `.test.tsx` files alongside components
**Test Standards**: Jest & React Testing Library following patterns from Epic 1 and Story 2.1
**Testing Frameworks**: 
- Jest for unit testing
- React Testing Library for component testing
- Mock Firestore responses for integration testing
**Specific Testing Requirements**:
- Form validation testing with invalid inputs
- Student application Firestore integration testing
- User flow testing from form submission to confirmation
- Error handling testing for Firestore failures
- Accessibility testing for form components
- Essay field validation testing
- Academic information validation testing
- Reference array validation testing
